1. Clarifying key decision criteria
Flavour, aroma, body, and uniformity are customer priorities. 
Do these four variables have equal importance, or should they be weighted differently?

2. Processing preferences
Washed/Wet Prefered. 
Should we exclude all suppliers that don’t use this method, or should we include them but rank them lower?

3. Supplier constraints & Broader business factors
Do you have any requirements in terms of the number of suppliers, one supplier for convenience, or multiple for diversity?
Do you have any ethical concerns about some countries/suppliers?
Are there cost, shipping, or trade regulation constraints we should also factor in, or is this purely a quality-driven decision?
Are there specific regions or countries you would like to avoid or prioritise for political, environmental, or ethical sourcing reasons?
Should we consder logistics e.g. Bag weight, and number of bags, are relevant to you? 

4. Handling imperfect data
Should we remove any rows where there is an N/A in an important column?

5. Presentation of results
Do you want us to produce a single “best country” recommendation, or also show a top 3–5 ranking for flexibility?
Should we also provide a sensitivity analysis showing how the recommendation changes if certain factors are weighted differently, this could be represented in a shiny app type?
