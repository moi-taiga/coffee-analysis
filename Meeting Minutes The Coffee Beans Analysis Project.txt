The Coffee Beans Analysis Project
Meeting with client: Espress Yourself – reputation for Artisan Coffee
Date: 12th August 2025, 16:00
Aroma, nutty chocolatey, warm rich, medium – wet processing
Customers have noted worsening
Replacement supplier needed
Identify a single country for procurement / flavour profile. Multiple exporters favoured in case of supply chain issues.
Limitations in terms of tiny batch processing, possibility for growth but not so massive bags that coffee spoils.
Price around average, fairtrade is important, climate change concerns due to increased crop failures, resilience for future changes, workers’ rights
Sliders on a dashboard
2 years old coffee limit
Washed and wet only to limit quality variability
Project delivery ASAP
Deliverables:
No spreadsheets – beautiful visual (graphs, dashboard with sliders to prioritise) maybe a filter on dashboard to exclude i.e. countries with less than 2 producers
Evidence – code needs to be available for other engineers
Identify minimum viable product (by day 3 / first sprint) and optional extras (by day 5 / second sprint).
Brown or beige presentation theme to match (copy of branding/website provided)
Fast, cheap, good trade-off
2 sprints in bootcamp
Goal is to identify a single country.
Missing input – list requested from client of NA fields to exclude
½ ton of beans / 500kg to be maintained at all times
