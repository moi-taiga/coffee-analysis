# coffee-analysis

## Description
We are a coffee company based in Southampton, UK, and are looking to improve where we source our coffee from. The quality of coffee sourced from our existing suppliers has significantly reduced in recent years, so we want to change suppliers whilst maintaining our reputation as the best artisanal coffee place in town. We have obtained a wealth of coffee supplier data from the independent Coffee Quality Institute, but we lack the skills required to analyse the data to help us decide where to send our coffee buyers to negotiate a new supply.
