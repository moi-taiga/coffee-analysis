# coffee-analysis

## Description
We are a coffee company based in Southampton, UK, and are looking to improve where we source our coffee from. The quality of coffee sourced from our existing suppliers has significantly reduced in recent years, so we want to change suppliers whilst maintaining our reputation as the best artisanal coffee place in town. We have obtained a wealth of coffee supplier data from the independent Coffee Quality Institute, but we lack the skills required to analyse the data to help us decide where to send our coffee buyers to negotiate a new supply.

## Pre-requisites
To run this analysis, you will need:

Python 3.8+ (a virtual environment is recommended)

Git (for cloning and version control)

Basic command-line experience (Linux/Unix familiarity helpful)

The cleaned coffee quality dataset in the expected directory (see Data Preparation)

Dependencies listed in requirements.txt

This code is designed for researchers or analysts familiar with Python data science tools. For best results, use a modern Linux/Unix environment with standard scientific Python stacks (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn). See the Installation section for setup instructions.
